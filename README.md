# 2D-Game
The 2D game being developed by Interactive media students from Coleraine as part of module MED 534

To start off add the repository locally to your computer, set up Github online and get the app, then go onto the project, go into 
scripts and uncomment the debug.log and save changes and push back. This will signal that we are all ong GitHub and have access to the 
project 

Good luck :)
